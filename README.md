# BingoGenerator

A script written for the University of Newcastle Medical Society's Halfway Dinner to provide guest table labels and bingo cards.

The script reads the guest list, generates each guest a name tag that will be used to mark their table. Each tag has a unique set of numbers for a game of Bingo to be played during the night.
